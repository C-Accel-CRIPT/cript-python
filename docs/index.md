**CRIPT** (the _Community Resource for Innovation in Polymer Technology_) is a web-based platform for capturing and sharing polymer data. In addition to a user interface, CRIPT enables programmatic access to the platform through the CRIPT Python SDK, which interfaces with a REST API.

## Disclaimer

Currently, CRIPT is only available for users in the USA, and it is equipped with geo-blocking functionality that restricts access for users outside the USA.

> We are diligently working towards making CRIPT accessible worldwide. 
We appreciate your patience as we strive to achieve this goal!

> [!NOTE]
> Once this package is [published to PyPI](https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/publish), this will become: `pip install --pre cript`
